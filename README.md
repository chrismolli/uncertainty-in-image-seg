# uncertainty-in-image-seg
Experimenting with Uncertainty Quantification of Image Segmentation Tasks.



Used on the [Satellite Images of Water Bodies](https://www.kaggle.com/christianmolliere/uncertainty-quantification-of-image-segmentation/data) dataset, which is available on Kaggle.

A modified version of the U-Net model was used to estimate the epistemic uncertainty present in the data. Some example results are shown below. Check the [notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/christianmolliere/uncertainty-quantification-of-image-segmentation) for the full results.
